# Snowtree

**Run multiple AI coding sessions in parallel, each in its own git worktree.**

## Why

- Single AI session blocks everything, manual worktree management is painful
- Trust issues? No clear view of what AI changed

**Snowtree solves this**:

- Parallel AI sessions (Claude Code, Codex)
- Auto-managed git worktrees
- Review & approve changes before commit
- Session history & timeline

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
